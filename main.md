# Abstract{.unnumbered}

- Introduce the eICU Collaborative Research Database.
- Valuable dataset for research and education.

# Introduction

- Introduction to the database [@Cousteau1963].
- Previously shared MIMIC-III [@MIMIC2016]

## Patient characteristics

- How many patients, characteristics, etc.
- Table 1 provides a breakdown of the population.
- Table 2 shows the most common ICD codes

## Classes of data

- Data includes time stamped physiological measurements, etc.
