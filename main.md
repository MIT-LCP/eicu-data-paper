<!-- The title should ideally be fewer than 120 characters, with a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (if appropriate), and should avoid abbreviations and unfamiliar acronyms if possible. Please note that two-part titles – e.g. “What goes up must come down: Oscillations in transcriptional networks” – are not permitted for research papers. -->

<!--
**One Sentence Summary:** We have released an open source library of
concepts related to critical illness derived from a publicly available
database to accelerate research.

<!--
The abstract should be fewer than 150 words and should not contain subheadings. It should provide a clear, measured, and concise summary of the work. If the biological system (species names or broader taxonomic groups if appropriate) is not mentioned in the title, it must be included in the abstract.
